# Quiz challenge

## Description <!-- omit in toc -->

Develop a backend for a real-time quiz application where users can join a quiz, answer questions, and see real-time results. We prefer that
you use NestJS for the backend framework, NATS for real-time event handling, and PostgreSQL for data storage. However, you are free to
use Node and other other event solution such as Kafka or RMQ.
